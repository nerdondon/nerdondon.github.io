## Prelude

These are just some of my notes and references from implementing a skip list in Rust. Creating a
skip list implementation that has concurrency features is my personal intro project to Rust so there
will also be some notes on lock-free and wait-free techniques. The overarching goal is to utilize
this skip list as the in-memory component of an LSM-tree based storage engine, that I will maybe,
hopefully, aspirationally, try to make. LevelDB in Rust if you will.

## Notes

- Used as the in-memory component of LevelDB's log structured merge tree (LSM tree) implementation

- Skip list vs self-balancing search trees (e.g. Red-black trees)

  - A skip list is more amenable to concurrency because less nodes are required to be updated during
    an insert

  - On update, a self-balancing tree may require multiple ancestors to be changed when the balancing
    operations (e.g. rotations in a Red-black tree)

- LevelDB is doesn't have concurrent writes? Source appears to require an external lock mechanism
  for writes.

- When used as the in-memory component of an LSM tree, the skip list should support sorting by
  reverse chronological order. This can be done by having a synthetic key with a timestamp/revision
  number or via reverse iteration by back pointers. This is because the LSM tree is an append only
  structure.

  - Using an RwLock can become a bottleneck for operations with a short critical section. You will
    effectively benchmarking the time it takes to lock and unlock.
