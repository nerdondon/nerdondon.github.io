## Will Sean Don (nerdondon)

Hi, I’m Sean (or Will depending on how old I was when I met you).

This blog will mainly be a bunch of random thoughts that I have on things from information security to information on securities (financial stuff if you don’t get the pun :D).
I’m a software engineer at a financial firm.

Oh, and I like to think of rhymes/puns/freestyles when I drive or get super bored. Maybe I’ll post some.
