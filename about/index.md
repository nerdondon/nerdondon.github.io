## Will Sean Don (nerdondon)

Hi, I’m Sean (or Will depending on how old I was when I met you).

This blog will mainly be a bunch of random thoughts that I have on things from information security
to information on securities (financial stuff if you don’t get the pun :D). I'm a software engineer
working for Google (usual all opinions my own blurb). Previously, I worked for AWS and for an
investment firm.

Oh, and I like to think of rhymes/puns/freestyles when I drive or get super bored. Maybe I’ll post
some.
