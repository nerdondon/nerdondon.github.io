## Will Don (nerdondon)

Hi, I’m Will.

This blog will mainly be a bunch of random thoughts that I have on things from information security to information on securities (financial stuff if you don’t get the pun :D). 
I’m a software engineer at a financial firm.

Oh, and I like to think of rhymes/puns/freestyles when I drive or get super bored. Maybe I’ll post some.
