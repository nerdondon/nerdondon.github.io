## Will Don (nerdondon/ender[cc])

Hi, I’m Will.

This blog will mainly be a bunch of random thoughts that I have on things from information security to information on securities (financial stuff if you don’t get the pun :D). I’m a software engineer at a financial firm. I’m also a Christian, so I may post about Christianity related subjects as well.

Currently, I’m studying for the FRM exam.

Oh, and I like to think of rhymes/puns/freestyles when I drive or get super bored. Maybe I’ll post some.

I’m also still a kid at a heart so you may find some really off-beat things on my reading list like Captain Underpants or Hunger Games.

…and no, I could not find a more organized way of writing this about me. It was really a stream-of-consciousness thing.
